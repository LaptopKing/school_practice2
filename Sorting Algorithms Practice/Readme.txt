Edit only Program.cs if you are new to this 
and if you don't know what the other files are doing. Or at least this is
recommended to do so it won't mess up the files.

You can find a Program.cs file, that is the file that you can modify to build your
desired ideas and to code it as well.

If you use VS Code and Terminal / Command Prompt to run your application, then use 
'dotnet run', it will run your whole program!
